  <P>For many of the programs and excercises you will do, we want to
see details of your on-line interactions with the program or with a tutorial etc. 
  For example,  we would like to see both the program and the results of running
  the program. The simplest way for you to do this is to use the
  unix script command:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Synopsis:</P>
    <P><B><TT>script scriptfile</TT></B></P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P><B><TT>script -a scriptfile</TT></B></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Where <TT>scriptfile</TT> is the name of the file you want
  script to create. Of course you can use a file name other than
  scriptfile. The <TT>-a</TT> is an option that tells the script
  command that you wish to append a new script to the file already existing scriptfile.
If you don't use -a and scriptfile already exists, then the new script will overwrite the
existing one. That is a mistake you may wish to avoid. </P>
  <H4>Here is an example.</H4>
  <P>Lets say you've written the required C programs program1.c, program2.c ... , for an
  assignment and you've conveniently named the executables program1,
  program2, etc. You would do the following to create a script file
  to print out and hand in, or to send in using the handin program (which will be explained later). 
Remember don't type the <B><TT>'&gt;'</TT></B>.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B><TT>&gt;script scriptfile</TT></B></P>
    <P><I>you will get a message saying a script has started.</I></P>
    <P><B><TT>&gt;cat program1.c</TT> </B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>the
    cat command will print out the contents of program1.c which
    will also go to the scriptfile</I></P>
    <P><B><TT>&gt; program1</TT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>this
    will run your program</I></P>
    <P><I>at this point you can repeat the steps for the other programs until
    you have executed all of your programs</I></P>
    <P><B><TT>&gt; exit</TT></B></P>
    <P><I>stop scripting<BR>
    ...do something else<BR>
    if you want to add anything to your scriptfile use the following:</I></P>
    <P><B><TT>&gt; script -a scriptfile</TT></B></P>
