CS 30, Winter 2008 HW 7.
This homework is due monday March 10 at 11:59 pm. No late homeworks will be accepted.

1. Do problem Problem 4b on p 236.

Name your source code reverse.c and hand it in using: handin cs30a p7 reverse.c 

Executable code will be posted later.

2. Examine program raggedarray2.c posted on the class website.

Write and add a new function called printdown that prints out the names in the reverse order to
how they are printed in printnames. Thus Heisenberg comes first and Newton comes last.

Write and add a new function called printchar that asks the user for a position less than or equal to the
length of the shortest name, and then prints out the character in that position in each of the strings. 

Write and add a new function called printallcharrev that prints each name reversed, but the order of the
names is their original order.

None of the three new functions can use any explicit arrays, so no square brackets are allowed, only 
pointer logic is allowed.

The output of your program should be the same as that of the executable which can be run on the csif machines at:

Name your source code raggedarray3.c and hand it in using: handin cs30a p7 raggedarray3.c
