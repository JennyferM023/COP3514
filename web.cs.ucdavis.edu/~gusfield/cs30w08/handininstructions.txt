Instructions on using the utility Handin

In this class you will sometimes hand in hardcopy printouts and sometimes send us files 
online using a utility called ``handin".  Here is a basic explanation on how to do that.

When you are logged on to one of the csif machines and you have  files there that you want to send in,
you just type the following on the command line:

handin cs30a subdirectory files...  

Where
``subdirectory" is a name of a subdirectory that we will give you for that exercise, and
"files" is a list of your files that you want to turn in. We will also tell you how to name those files.

For example,
if you are sending in files that are for the first exercise, we may tell you to use
a subdirectory called ex1, and name the files b1 and b2. Then   the command to use
would be:

handin cs30a ex1 b1 b2
