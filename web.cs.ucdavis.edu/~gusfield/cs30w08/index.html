Programming and Problem Solving using C - Winter 2008
Gusfield
</H2>

<li> This index page will just link to the various course handouts that
are available on the web, and provide some description of them. 

<H3>Distribution List</H3>
<ol>
<LI> <A HREF="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/unix.html"> Matloff's tutorial page </a> In week one,
read Matloff's tutorials on Unix (at least the sections titled `if you have no Unix background at all' and
'the Unix file system'), and if you need a Unix based editor, read the tutorials on Vi, Vim and/or emacs. These
are pdf files which should download to your computer.  If you want to install linux on your pc, read those pages.
<br>
<br>
<li> There are three computer labs in CSIF, in the basement of Kemper Hall, that have computers for your use in this class.
 Everyone who is enrolled should have a computer account set up for the computers 
in the CS Instructional facility (CSIF) in the
basement of Kemper Hall. Go to the glass window opposite room 83 to look up your user name - usually just your
last name. Your initial password is the last 8 digits of your student ID (which has nine digits).  If you want
to change your password, and you should want to, read the man file for the Unix command yppasswd 
(type man yppasswd), to learn more about the command.
Help is available in room 47 for using the labs. Note that this help is for using
the labs, not help with CS 30. For specific help with CS 30, you need to see one of the course TAs.
<br>
<br>
<li>
You may also log into the CSIF machines remotely (details can be found 
at 
<a href = "http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~davis/30/UC%20Davis%20Computer%20Science%20at%20Home.htm"> UCDAVIS
computer science at home </a>). Or you can work on any other machine
that has Unix, and a C compiler for writing C programs, and internet access. NOTE: Different
systems (operating systems, computer type, configurations, libraries etc.) can behave differently, so a C program
written on one machine and system might not behave the same on a different machine or system (an ugly reality!). 
You may find it
more convenient to do most of your work at home, or in another lab, BUT before handing in your program, you must
make sure
it works correctly on the machines in the CSIF. Those are the machines we will use when we compile, run and grade
your programs. If your programs don't run correctly there, it will not matter to the grader that they ran correctly 
elsewhere. It is your responsibility to port your programs in time to the CSIF and test them there. It will
not be a legitimate excuse that the connection to the CSIF was down just before the assignment was due. Also,
we (Professor Gusfield and the TAs) can only give very limited help on problems you encounter on machines and
systems outside of the CSIF, and how to set up the software to work at home, or connect to the CSIF remotely.
Campus IT staff and the CSIF staff can also help somewhat on those issues if you run into problems.
<br>
<br>
<li> Unless stated otherwise on a homework assignment, all assignments are meant to be done individually. Of course
you can discuss some aspects of the assignment with others, particularly what the assignment asks for, but each
student is expected to individually figure out how to set up the program, how to use the correct parts of C 
in the program, and how to write and test the program. 
If you have any questions about the degree of individuality that is expected, please ask. We may routinely
run all the submitted homework programs through a utility that finds pairs of programs that are 
``too similar". We really don't like dealing with situations when we find such a pair of programs, so please 
design and write your programs yourself.
Also, you will learn much more that way, and be better prepared for exams.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li>  Discussion sections (Weds. and Thurs.) WILL be held this week (Jan. 9, 10) as scheduled. 
HOWEVER, for this week only, they will
be held in the CSIF computer labs in the basement of Kemper Hall. Those are rooms 67 and 75 (come to room 67 first)
in Kemper Hall. The  are to help you get going on your first assignment and on logging in etc. If you take
a look at the assignment and think you need the help, please come to your assigned discussion section, so we 
don't have too many people at any one.
<br>
Also, TAs will be in those rooms on Wed., Thurs, and Friday evenings from 6-7 pm, this week only,
to help with the first assignment.
<br>
<li> After the first week, all the discussion sections will be held in their scheduled classrooms, rather than
in the Kemper Hall computer labs.

that your files be names as specified (and expected) please be sure to name your script file cel2script, 
but don't worry about it if you have already handed in your script file and called it cel2cript instead
of cel2script.

<br>
<br>
<li>URGENT: PLEASE READ: Jan. 28, 6:15. We just started testing an automated grading
program for HW 2. It has INCORRECTLY written to all students that it cannot
find their HW 2. We know this is an error and will correct it shortly. So
please do not be alarmed. There is also no need to write to us about this.
We are sorry for any panic it caused. 
<br>
<br>
<li> If you submitted the source code for HW 2 but did not get an email from us with
results (although there may not be any stated grade in that email), please write to
freemalloc@yahoo.com
<br>
If you submitted executable code for HW 2 (about 15 students did this) and you have not
gotten email about this, please write to pchowdhury@ucdavis.edu
<br>
In either case be sure to include the user name on your CSIF account, the directory that you used
when you handed in HW 2, and your email address.

<li> <a href = "mid1.txt"> First midterm from winter 07 </a>
This is midterm 1 from the CS30 class I taught last year. The figure for the first question is missing, but you
can understand the **type** of question it is. The midterm this year might be a little longer since
the class this year is a T,Th class, and last year the students only had 50 minutes.

<a href = "h4.txt"> Fourth Homework </a>
<br>
<br>
<li> Sorry, Professor Gusfield will be out of the office on monday Feb. 4, so will not have office hours Feb. 4.
<br>
<br>
<li> Sorry again, Professor Gusfield will be out of town on Thursday Feb. 8, so will not have office hours Feb. 8.
<br>
<br>
<li> The midterm on Thursday Feb. 7 will be open book and notes. It is also suggested that you bring copies of programs
distributed through the class website. No bluebooks will be required.  The midterm covers everything discussed in 
class, and the readings in the book through chapter 7.
<br>
<br>
<li> The protections on the source code (the .c files) on the csif machines, for the programs on HW 2 and 3 has now been set so that you can see the
source code. 
<br>
<br>
<li> The following programs were discussed on February 5.

<li>
<a href = "mid1sol.txt"> solutions to the sample (2007) midterm </a>
<li> twin prime update - contrary to what was written in the original 
homework 4 writeup, 9 is not a prime number. The hw 4 writeup has
been modified to correct that brain hiccup.
<br>
<li> The executable for prettyline can be executed on a csif machine by typing
<br>
~gusfield/cs30w08/prettyline
<br>
It has been reported that my program does not do the right thing if one puts in spaces after the last non-space
character on a line (i.e., before the return). So, don't use such lines in your test input (I guess I didn't).
If your program does not have that problem, don't change
it to have that problem. In other words: "do what I say, not what I do".

Max possible: 125,
Max obtained: 125 (yes, it used to say 124, but that was an error),
Mean : 93.6,  
Median: 100,  
std dev: 20.6,  
total number of scores: 158

<li> A student just pointed out that unless the correspondence between the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3
and the legal moves in program walk.c are the same in my and your program, we will not get the
same results.  In my program 0 corresponds to up, 1 to left, 2 to down and 3 to right.

<br>
<a href = "power.c"> power.c </a>
<br>
<br>
<li> Mini-Midterm Feb. 28.  As I announced in class yesterday, there will
be a mini-midterm covering chapters 8,9,10 on Feb. 28. with emphasis on 
arrays and functions. There is not much new material in Chapter 10, and we
will cover it quickly in the next lecture. The midterm will only be 45 minutes
long, so we can have a partial lecture on Feb. 28 also.
<li>  David Camp will try to have extra TA office hours Thursday, Feb. 21 from 5-7
<br>
<li>The programs discussed in class Feb. 21:
<br>
<a href = "binary1.c"> binary1.c </a>

<br>
<a href = "binary2script"> binary2script </a>
<br>
<a href = "infile"> infile </a>
<br>
I said in class yesterday that this homework would require you to write a recursive program for
binary search, but later I decided against that. It is still a good exercise for you to consder
doing sometime.
<br>
<li> The solution programs from HW 5:
<br>
<a href = "walk.c"> walk.c </a>
<br>
<a href = "permute.c"> permute.c </a>
<li> Two sample array problems for midterm 2:
<a href = "midarr.txt">  array problems </a>
<li> The executable version of funarr (for HW 6) can be run on any csif machine by

<br>
You can also make an infile and use redirection to reduce your typeing  when working on 
your version of funarr.c

<br>
<a href = "raggedarray.c"> raggedarray.c </a>
<br>
<a href = "raggedarray2.c"> raggedarray2.c </a>
<br>
<li> NOTE: Now that we only have four lectures left, we will be going faster in lecture. Also,
now that we are discussing pointers and arrays, the material is more confusing than before.
Therefore, I strongly advise people to attend the lectures. I know that up to now, many people have
been able to follow the class up to now just by reading the class website, looking at the
programs presented in each class, doing the HWs etc, but I think that will be more difficult
to do from here on.
<li> Seventh Homework, due by Monday March 10, 11:59pm. 
<a href = "h7.txt"> Seventh Homework </a>
<li> <a href = "http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~davis/30/gdb_Tutorial.htm"> Tutorial on gdb and ddd </a>
Teach yourself the basics of the gdb debugger and debugging. At a minimum learn how to list, execute one
line at a time, set and unset breakpoints, print variable values. The use of a debugger is often essential.
gdb is available on most unix based systems. ddd is a GUI based on gdb. Use it if you have it.
<li> The executable for problem 4b (part of HW 7) can be run on a csif machine by typing

<br>
<li> The final exam will be open book and notes, exactly as in the midterms (no laptops or neighbors - if the
person sitting next to you has the same name, first or last, please move). All material from the entire course
is fair game, but the emphasis will be on material since the second midterm. The material since the midterm
is covered in: All of chapter 13 (except command line arguments); 15.1, most of 15.2, p. 320 - 322 on makefiles;
16.1, 16.2, 16.3; 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 (but I didn't mention realloc in lecture), p. 368, 369 of 17.4 (the free
function); I briefly mumbled somthing about linked lists (section 17.5) at the end of the last lecture. I won't
include that on the exam, but you should read 17.5 if you are going on to cs 40 (or if you just want to know about
linked lists).
<li> 
<li> The CS30 final exam from Winter 2007 
<a href = "final.txt">  final 2007. </a> At least two problems in that exam were 
based explicitly on programs seen
in that class, and so they will probably seem much harder to you then they did to the 2007 class. So
don't panic if this exam seems very hard. Also, there is a question about recursive programs on the 2007
exam, but we did not go into recursion as heavily this year, so I will not ask such a hard question
about recursion on the 2008 exam.  However, some question about recursive  programs is fair.

I had to change the second problem on the homework (simpler now) because when I 
programmed it I saw some problems in the original statement. So be sure to check the
current version of h2 before you start working on problem 2. 
<br>
<li> You can execute the executable code for graph.c  by logging into a csif
machine and then issuing the command
<br>
~gusfield/cs30/graph

This is the program I showed at the end of the class, but then
when I ran it, the wrong output come out, so we thought it had a
problem. Actually, it is fine, but in class I ran the wrong program
by accident.

<li> Midterm Friday Jan. 26. This will be open book and notes. The material
covered will be Unix commands, and up through Chapter 4 in the text. Emphasis
will be on material covered in class and homeworks, not on the sections in the text
we skipped. The best preparation is to review all the readings, homeworks and
programs discussed in class. Practice midterm #1 on Sean Davis's website
<br>
<href = "http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~davis/30/PracMid1.htm"> Practice </a>
contains questions of the style and difficulty of the questions that will be on our midterm, 
except for question 1 covering some material that we didn't cover.
<li> Course grading will be based 34% on the Homeworks (programs), 33% on the two midterms,
and 33% on the final exam.

<li> 
Be sure to write your homework programs so that the input to the program is as described in the problem, and as 
exhibited by the posted executable program (when there is one). For example, problem 2 in homework 5 
specifies that the program should get the series
of integers first, and then p. Also, the executable program does not expect a comma between each integer in
the series. The reason for requiring this uniformity in input and output is to speed up the grading of your program.
If your input and output design is different than what is expected, it really takes more time to grade, meaning
that less attention can be given to each students work.
<li> Feb. 8, Along the lines of the above message, I would like to make a small change to the instructions
of problem 2 in homework 5. Instead of inputing a series of integers, input a series of POSITIVE integers,
and instead of ending the series with an EOF, end with a negative number. Otherwise the instructions
for homework 5 are the same. This change will allow you (and us) to more easilly execute the program
by inputing from a file, instead of at the keyboard. That will make grading much faster.
If you have already submitted you homework, you can make the change to the program and resubmit via
handin (it just replaces the prior submission). If you have submitted and can't make the change,
that is ok also. Thanks.

Since the size of an array must be explicitly declared (up to
this point in the class), your program will only work for strings up to some fixed length. Assume that the program
should work for strings up to length 100. With that point, you should be able to use only one pair of square brackets,
but it is a bit of a trick. If you need to, you can use two pairs of square brackets in the program.

Look at

Note that the structure is defined outside of
main, so that the function prototype of function f can come after the declaration of the structure. Also, since
students is an array of structures, and whenever an array name is used by itself, it is actually the address of
the first element, we can pass the array in the call to f by just naming the array, i.e., without any
explicit address operator.
