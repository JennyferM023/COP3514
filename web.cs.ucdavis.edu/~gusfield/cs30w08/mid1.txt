Name:


CS 30 Winter 2007 Midterm 1 - Open book and notes, but NOT open laptop (sorry).
Write your answers on the exam (use side or back if needed). There are 
130 total points possible.

1. (30 pts - 5 pts each) Suppose you have a Unix file system as shown in the
Figure 1. Names that are underlined are directories, and other names
are regular files. Suppose you are presently in directory Tuesday.
Show the unix commands needed to accomplish the following tasks,
in the order given (that is, imagine you are on an actual unix
system with this file structure, so each task done has had an effect
before the next task is done. Also, each task may require several
commands).

a. Make a copy in directory Tuesday of the file inferno and call it inf1.

b. Make a copy in directory Monday of the file inferno. 

c. Change the name of file avacado to pizza.

d. Move to the parent of directory Monday. 

e. Delete directory Monday.

f. Create a subdirectory below Weds named NextWeds, and move the file telescope to NextWeds.


2. (20 pts) What does the following program print?

#include<stdio.h>

main()
{
int i;

i = 17;
while (i <= 28) {
  printf("%d ", i++);
  i = i + 3;
}
}



3. (20 pts) Rewrite the program in problem 2 using a for loop instead of a while statement.












4. (20 pts)  What does the following program print out?

#include<stdio.h>

main()
{
int i,j,k;


for (i = 1;   i <= 2 ;  i++) {
        for (j = i+1; j <= 4; j++) {
                for (k = j+2; k <= 7; k++) {
                printf("%d %d %d\n", i, j, k);
                }
        }
}
}



5. (40 pts) Write a program that asks the user to input a list of
real numbers which can either be positive or negative or zero.
Inputing ends when the user enters the EOF symbol.  The program
counts the number of input numbers that are strictly positive, the
number that are zero and the number that are strictly negative, and
prints out those three counts, along with appropriate explanation of 
the output.  The program also computes the product of all
the strictly positive numbers and prints that number.
