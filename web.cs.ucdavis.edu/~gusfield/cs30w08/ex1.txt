CS 30 Winter 2008 First Exercise

In this exercise will work your way through a tutorial on Unix. The tutorial is the 'ECS 30 Unix Tutorial'
reached from 

http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~davis/30

Before starting the tutorial also read the material on scripting that is posted on
the CS 30 class website www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/cs30w08. It will also be helpful to have read
the posted material on using handin, although that is also covered during the tutorial.

Then, after logging in to a csif machine, open a browser and get to the above Unix Tutorial on the browser.
Also, open a unix window where you will issue your unix commands during the tutorial.

Next, start reading the tutorial, and do any of the suggested commands discussed
in the tutorial. 
The tutorial takes you through
basic Unix commands and the use of handin.  In that turtorial, two sections are mentioned, cs30a and cs30b.
You should only use cs30a when you use handin.

The handin for the tutorial needs to be completed by Tuesday Jan. 15 at 11:59pm. Note that the time stamp
is the time the script is submitted via handin. You may be able to complete the tutorial on your own,
but on Weds, Thurs. and Friday nights Jan. 9, 10, 11 from 6-7 there will be TAs in the CSIF labs to help out.


NOTE: the webpage listed above is from ECS 30 this fall (2007), so the syllabus posted there is NOT
for our class.  Other items linked from that webpage  may be of interest, and you will be directed to
read some of them later.
