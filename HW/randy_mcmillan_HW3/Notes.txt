auto storage duration

block scope

local var only visible in that block of code


void f(void) {


static int i; /* still block scope but available for duration of execution */

global vars are auto static

macro is not a global variable

{ anything between is a block }

06062016 NOTES

byte addressable

one byte has a unique address

C you have to declare the data type...


int *p;

p is capable of pointing to an int

pointers can have values or be null

astericks are used to declare a pointer


int *p; points to nowhere in particular

TEST 2 POINTERS


int i, *p;

p = &i;


printf("%d\n", *p);

j= *&i; same as j=i;


//
p = &i;

i =1;

*p = 2;


//

p = q;

*p = 1;
i equals 1


*q = 2;
i equals 2



p = &i;


//
